# Abstract
Originally in response to [NL 029 : Disallow zero-width and control characters](https://github.com/cplusplus/nbballot/issues/28)

Adopt Unicode Annex 31 as part of C++ 23.
- That C++ identifiers match the pattern (XID\_START + \_ ) + XID_CONTINUE\*.
- That portable source is required to be normalized as NFC.
- That using unassigned code points ill-formed.

# NL 029
## Comment
Allowed characters include those from U+200b until U+206x; these are zero-width and control characters that lead to impossible to type names, indistinguishable names and unusable code & compile errors (such as those accidentally including RTL modifiers).

## Proposed Change
Disallow invisible characters in this range

# Identifiers
Identifiers are used in C++ to name entities
Named enties include
- typedefs
- types
- namespaces
- namespace aliases
- classes
- enums
- templates
- user-defined literal suffixes
- captures in lambda expressions
- labels for statements
- enumerators
- attributes
- the parts of module names between optional '.'
- members of classes
- template type parameters
- template type constraints
- concept names
- preprocessor defines
- function names
- function parameters

There are few names that are not identifiers, but in particular headers and header files are not named by identifiers. The introduction of a raw string literal is constrainted to be composed of members of the basic source character set, and does not follow the identifier grammar.

# Addressing identifiers in a more principled ways
[UNICODE IDENTIFIER AND PATTERN SYNTAX](https://unicode.org/reports/tr31/) (UAX31) is an attempt to provide a normative way of specifying definitions of general-purpose identifiers for use in programming languages. It has evolved significantly over the years, in particular since the time that C++ 11 was specified. In particular, the characters that were allowed as identifiers, and the patterns, were not stable at the time of C++11, which is the last time identifiers were addressed in the standard. In addition, at that time, ISO was promulgating advice suggesting a list of code points as the recommended method for ISO standards to specify identifiers.

Today the definitions in UAX31 can be used to provide stable definitions for programming language identifiers, with guarantees that an identifier will not be invalidated by later standards.

Originally, UAX31 relied on derived properties of characters, ID\_START and ID\_CONTINUE, however those properties relied on fundamental properties that could change over time. The unicode database now provides XID\_START and XID\_CONTINUE, based on the same characteristics, but with an additional stability guarantee. The Unicode database now provides explicit classification of both.

The original definitions closely match the identifier syntax of C:

The X versions of the properties start the same, but are guaranteed stable in subsequent Unicode standards

# Issues with base UAX31
### Continue does not include ZWJ, which some scripts require
The scripts that do are somewhat exotic, and allowing zero width joiners generally would lead to confusion.
### Does not exclude homoglyph attack
Homoglyph attacks, where visually indistinguishable characters from different scripts are used to create confusion, such as between latin letter c and cyrillic letter c. This is covered by Unicode Technical Report #36 [UNICODE SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/). It requires much more extensive analysis of text, using the full unicode database, and for a compiled language would provide limited benefit.
### Does not allow emoji
~~~ C++
class \U0001F4A9 : public std::exception {};
~~~
Throwing &#x1f4a9; becomes ill-formed. Conference slide-ware will be less entertaining.

# History
Using an explicit list of Unicode characters was considered a best practice for ISO standardization in TR 10176:2003 Guidelines for the preparation of programming language standards.

National body comment CA 24 for C++11

> A list of issues related TR 10176:2003:
>
> - "Combining characters should not appear as the first character of an identifier." Reference: ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003 (Annex A) This is not reflected in FCD.
> - Restrictions on the first character of an identifier are not observed as recommended in TR 10176:2003. The inclusion of digits (outside of those in the basic character set) under identifer-nondigit is implied by FCD.
> - It is implied that only the "main listing" from Annex A is included for C++. That is, the list ends with the Special Characters section. This is not made explicit in FCD. Existing practice in C++03 as well as WG 14 (C, as of N1425) and WG 4 (COBOL, as of N4315) is to include a list in a normative Annex.
> - Specify width sensitivity as implied by C++03: \uFF21 is not the same as A. Case sensitivity is already stated in [lex.name].


N3146 in 2010-10-04 considered using UAX31, but at the time there were stability issues with identifiers, and came down on the side of explicit white listing.

The Unicode standard has since made stability guarantees about identifiers, and created the XID\_START and XID\_CONTINUE properties to alleviate the stability concerns that existed in 2010.

# Normalization Discussion
Comparing unicode strings can be complicated because there may be many ways of encoding a grapheme cluster that appears to be the same, and in fact may be canonically the same. There are combining  characters such that there are two or more ways of, e.g., spelling À. It could be spelled as either 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE' (U+00C0), or as the combination of 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A (U+0041)' and  'COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT' (U+0300).

~~~C++
constexpr int À = 1; // U+00C0
constexpr int À = 2; // U+0041 U+0300
constexpr int gv1 = \u00c0;
constexpr int gv2 = A\u0300;
static_assert(gv1 == 1);
static_assert(gv2 == 2);

Although changing the comparison rules could break code, this is a case that is frustrating for working programmers and removing the ability to spell À two different ways is not something anyone should be relying on.

According to UAX31, the Unicode Normalization Form C is the most appropriate form for string equivalence checks for identifiers in languages that do not case fold, and SG16 agrees on this. NFC compares based on combining all characters into canonical forms, so that characters that are canonically the same, such as the Angstrom sign and A with ring, are folded into a single code point for comparison. As many editors will do this automatically, and there is no way of visually detecting the difference, canonical equivalence is the most appropriate form to check.

However, linkers will compare identifiers by octets.

Therefore, normalization of identifiers must happen before object files are emitted. it is either the responsibility of programmers to provide normalized identifiers, and compiler to either warn or error on non-normalized ones, or for compilers to normalize unicode input. For non-unicode input, the transformation to normalized form is the simple table based lookup used to translate now.

Detection of un-normalized text is fairly straignt-forward, and GCC 10 already produces a warning. Normalizing to NFC is not much more difficult. In SG16 discussions it has been pointed out that IFNDR is usually reserved for situatios where it is difficult or impossible to identify the problem, where for non-normalized text it is merely a metter of code. However, we need feedback from implementers, particularly since this is a potentially breaking change.
